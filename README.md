# Bullshit Bingo - Electron Edition

This is a very simple implementation of the game "Bullshit Bingo" 
or as it may be called by those who are offended by words "Buzzword Bingo". 
It is just like normal Bingo, but instead of numbers, the +card+ consists of words 
which are often heard when listening to fast speaking, slick sales types or pinty 
haired bosses who are out of their depth, but want to sound knowledgeable. 

At the end of the day, it is all just a bit of fun. Can't deal or find it offensive, 
move on. Life is too short to take this crap seriously.

## Purpose

The real purpose for this repo is to have something to experiment with. When 
evaluating new technology, languages, frameworks, etc, you need something to 
base your evaluation on. It seems the current practice is to use a /todo list/ or
some form of /shoping list/ application to do this. Unfortunately, that crosses my 
bordum threshold. Bullshit Bingo to the rescue!

### Approach

In this repo, I plan to implement a basic, but functional, version of the game 
Bullshit Bingo using Electron to create a desktop version which will run on Windows, 
Mac and Linux.

The basic aproach will be to first implement the game using nothing but the 
bare necessities. As far as possible, vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. No 
frameworks (apart from Electron of course), template systems or any other
add-ons. 

Once the basic applicaiton is working, I will then create branches for different
versions of the application which use different frameworks and libraries to either 
address /pain points/ in the original development - those things which were harder
to do than they should be or which could become cleaner or clearer through the use
of a library/framework or add new features which are difficult to do with just vanilla
Javascript and CSS. 

### Other Uses

A secondary reason for this repository is to document my own journey with these 
technologies and provide some examples which others might find useful. I also 
hope to document some of this journey as experience has taught me that sometimes, 
you need to take the wrong road before you find the right one. Personally, I've 
probably learnt more from what I've done wrong than from what I've done right. 

I would also encourage comments and feedback. Discussion tends to help expand ideas
and learn new perspectives. Ideally, I would love to meet up with other developers, 
but living in a small city (only 22k population) and being 6+ hours away from any 
major metropolitan area, finding like minded people locally is hard. Therefore,
most of my interaction is on-line. 

## Installation

Nothing to install yet. Feel free to clone the repo, but don't expect anything 
signficant just yet!

### Documentation

Very unlikely there will be much /real/ documentation. However, I will keep notes
and other information which documents the process and my experiences in the +docs+
directory.
